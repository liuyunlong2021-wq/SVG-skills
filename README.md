# SVG Animation Engineer (AI Skill)

A highly specialized AI Skill (prompt instruction set) designed to turn any AI Assistant into a **Master SVG Animation Engineer**. It enforces strict generation rules to produce clean, cross-browser compatible, and visually stunning 2.5D geometric vector animations using **pure SVG and CSS Keyframes**.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Zero Dependencies**: Generates raw `.svg` or `.html` files that run flawlessly in any modern browser without external libraries (No GSAP, no Lottie needed).
- **Geometric Flat Design**: Enforces a strict aesthetic of flat illustration, high-contrast corporate/macaron color palettes, and perfect geometric shapes.
- **Physical Motion Principles**:
  - **Squash & Stretch**: Simulates elasticity and gravity (e.g., bouncing, pulsing).
  - **Overlapping Action**: Employs `animation-delay` for trailing elements (e.g., waving hair, gears turning with slight offsets).
  - **Parallax Backgrounds**: Creates infinite, seamless looping backgrounds to simulate depth and travel.
- **Cross-Browser Stability**: Enforces `transform-box: fill-box` and static nested `<g>` tags to completely eliminate the notorious SVG CSS `transform-origin` bugs seen in Safari and some Chromium builds.

## 🚀 How to Use

Simply copy this folder into your AI Agent's skill or prompt directory, or pass the contents of `SKILL.md` directly into your system prompt.

### Recommended Directory Structure for Agents

```text
.agent/
 └── skills/
      └── svg-animation-engineer/
           ├── SKILL.md                 # Core instructions & Output Templates
           ├── references/
           │    └── motion-examples.md  # CSS exact implementations (Progressive Disclosure)
           └── examples/                # (Optional) Showcase of generated results
```

### Example Prompting

Once the skill is loaded in your AI context, you can simply ask:
> *"Use the svg-animation-engineer skill to draw me a seamless looping animated scene of a fox riding a skateboard through a cyberpunk city."*

## 📁 Repository Contents

- **`SKILL.md`**: The brain of the skill. Contains the core aesthetic rules, physical laws, and an exact XML/SVG output template pattern that the AI must follow.
- **`references/motion-examples.md`**: Advanced references. We use the "Progressive Disclosure" pattern so the AI only reads these complex CSS examples (like exact bezier curves for bouncing) when necessary.
- **`examples/`**: Contains raw SVG/HTML files purely generated by this skill as a demonstration of its power.

## 🎨 Demo / Examples

Check out the `examples/` folder for live code generated by this skill:

1. **`validation_test_astronaut.svg`**: A floating astronaut waving in space with a pulsing jetpack flame.
2. **`riding_giraffe_style.svg`**: A beautiful sunset silhouette of a character riding a giraffe.
3. **`ore_process.html`**: A massive, highly complex industrial 2.5D animation showing a 4-stage ore processing plant (Jaw Crushers, Ball Mills, Flotation Tanks with froth physics, and Thickeners).

*(You can open any of these files directly in Chrome/Safari to see the animations in action!)*
